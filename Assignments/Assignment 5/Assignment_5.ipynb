    "# Exercise 1. The Effect of Minimum Wage on Employment - Difference-in-Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are going to look at a classic paper in the labor economics literature (note that we are only giving you a subset of the data, so your results are not going to match the results in the paper). This paper answers a very important (and often controversial!) question in economic policy: does increasing the minimum wage increase unemployment (or conversely, reduce employment)? Proponents of minimum wage laws point to the benefits for individuals who remain employed in low wage jobs. Opponents of minimum wage laws argue that the increases in labor costs result in higher unemployment because employers hire less employees to offset the cost increases. Card and Krueger (1994) test this latter hypothesis using the minimum wage increase in New Jersey that went into effect in 1992. They surveyed fast food establishments in New Jersey and Pennsylvania both before and after the policy came into effect, collecting information on wages, employment and prices. Pre-policy change interviews are coded as 1992 and post-policy change interviews are coded as 1993 in your data for the sake of simplicity. This data is then used to obtain a difference-in-differences estimate of the effect of minimum wage laws on employment. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will look at the effect of replacing highly-polluting school buses on students' health. Many school districts in California, particularly less wealthy school districts, have school buses that are many decades old. These buses do not have many of the pollution controls that are now standard in vehicles, exposing the students that ride them to high concentrations of pollutants. In 2006, the state of California passed a proposition that allocated funds towards replacing the oldest of these school buses with new models that had adequate pollution controls. We have data for these replacements for the years 2009-2012, with the number of replacements per year more or less increasing over the sample period. This data is combined with attendance data from all school districts in California over the same period to test the impact of reducing pollution exposure through bus replacements on student health. Attendance is used to measure student health because students who are chronically ill are often absent from school. The full dataset is described in detail below.\n",
